# Brief Description

This will be a web application which will follow a classic To-Do List using Rails and React

The idea would be using React on the front end to collect and sort the customers list of tasks and have it save to the Rails back end


## Rails Outline (so far)

- User: The user whom can create an account, login, logout
- List: The name of the "To-Do" list. Can be created, updated, deleted
Should belong to user. And a user can have many lists or just one
- Task: The actual things "to-do". Can be created, read, updated, deleted
Should be long to a List (possible many), Each list should have many tasks
